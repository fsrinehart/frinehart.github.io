## Enhancement One - Software Design and Engineering

The artifact is called medicalApplication, which is a Java application that was created in was created in CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance during 20EW5. The purpose of this artifact is to provide a medical record to describe the hospital system.  The application allows the user to input information but also collect information. The type of information includes doctors, patients, allergies, and other medical records. Additionally, employees can access the system and input the own record into the application. 

The artifact was selected to demonstrate my skills and experience in the Java application. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to combine different classes in the Java application. The specific components that I wanted to show are the ability to create, modify, and delete classes. This type of demonstration shows my ability to make enhancements based on complexity. Additionally, I want to show that I can make this artifact more secured since there are bugs and errors found in it.  

The artifact was improved by applying defensive programming to the artifact. This was done by removing the employee class, which has the helped protect the application from being compromised. Next, I corrected the misspelling that was found in medicalrecordservice before including it into the doctor class. For treatment class, I made changes to it by implementing private string doctor. When making this change, it allowed the doctor class to display the prescribed medication. 

I have made some improvements to the software application. This was done by making some modification to classes and deleting unnecessary classes. Additionally, I expanded the artifacts complexity by adding classes, such as medicalrecordservice and treatment into the doctor class. There has been positive feedback from the artifact now accessing the medical record system. 

When making improvements to the software application, I learned the functionality of it. The application itself was able to run based on a series of Java classes. During this process, I learned to get the Java classes to interact with each other, which helped run the application. However, there were some challenges during this process. For instance, I had trouble correcting medicalrecordservice because of a typo in the source code. When I corrected then name, I had to search through all the application that had a similar name and correct those as well. Nevertheless, I overcame these challenges by testing the application multiple times.
