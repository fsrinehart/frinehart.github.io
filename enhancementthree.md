## Enhancement Three 
### Database

The name of the artifact is called restFUL API, which was created in CS-340: Advanced Programming Concepts during 20EW1. The program language that was written to create this artifact is in Python. The purpose of this artifact is connected to other applications, which is why API stands for application programming interface. The artifact created in CS-340 was developed to connect to other applications when running it on Codio. There were multiple source files created to successfully run restFUL API in MongoDB. 

The reason I selected this artifact is because of the advanced concepts that were used in it. In the other courses, we learned about databases; however, I did not apply the programming concepts in them compared to this artifact. There are three components found in the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities. These components demonstrate my ability to create an interface that can communicate in MongoDB. I demonstrate my ability to use an assignment program language, such as Python to expand the restFUL API. 

The artifact was improved by designing some of the components, as well as combining them. For the user documentation, I took components out of the original artifact and designed it in the new component. This allowed me the user documentation into one file, instead of multiple files. Similarity, I did the same thing for the restFUL API by using order components to redesign in the updated artifact. I found that when testing the artifacts, the application not only worked but performed faster compared to the original artifact. 

I was able to take parts of the old artifact and combine them into the newer artifact. This allowed me to reach my intended goal, which was to make the artifact i least two or three files. When I resigned the artifact, at the end I was able to successfully run the application on MongoDB. Each of the components gained elements from the older artifact; however, they are still restFUL API and user documentation. 

When modifying the artifact, I learned about the process of database management in application programming. During the early stages of the development, I learned how to store data but also retrieve it from a database. Now, the were some challenges when modifying the artifact for database, such as errors. Majority of the problems that I ran into the artifact were due to syntax error. However, I was able to overcome this challenge by using comments and running the application every three lines. If I found the potential error, I would use comment to see if it would run without it. These steps helped me redesign the artifact to where I was able to successfully run it.
