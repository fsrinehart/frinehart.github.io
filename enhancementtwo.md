## Enhancement Two 
### Algorithm and Data Structures

The artifact is called ZooAuth, which is short for Zoo Authentication. This application was created in IT-145: Foundation in Application Development during 19EW1. The purpose of this artifact is to allowed users to gain into the zoo authentication system. This includes the user inputting their credentials to access it.  The application allows zoo employees to input, update, and delete their information in the system.  

The artifact, ZooAuth was created to demonstrate my abilities to write algorithm and data structure in Java. I want to demonstrate my abilities to improve data structure and algorithm by using my skills. This includes using my skills to re-engineer the data structure and algorithm to do a specific task. The specific component includes mastering in arrays, list, binary tree, and has tables. These skills will allow me to showcase my skills expand an application, such as ZooAuth and make it more efficient. 

There were some improvements made in the artifact to make it more secured. This was done by including a method to protect the password, such as a hash. Additionally, I implemented an if-else statement when the user attempts to login. If the user inputs the incorrect password three times, then the user will be locked out of the system. This type of defensive programming helps protect the system from being compromised from unauthorized access. 

One thing I have been able to accomplish is create a method for credentials. This allows the software application to get the username, password, and their role. When this happens, the application will retrieve the data from credentials.txt. Another accomplishment is including a new scanner that is in place after the user closes out a file. This happens when the user finishes reading a file in the application, then goes to another one. 

When modifying the artifact, I learned how to improve the log in process to the application. For instance, I learned how to include additionally if-else statement which made it more secured. Additionally, I learned how to improve the attempt log in by using basic arithmetic. However, the challenge I faced was modifying the login attempts. At first the user was automatically kicked out of the system when trying to login the first time. I was able to overcome this challenge by including an increment a variable, then place it into the if-else statement. When this worked, the user was given at least three attempts to try to login before being kicked out.
